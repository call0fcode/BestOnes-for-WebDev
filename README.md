# The Best Ones for Web Development
This is a collection of resources that I personally find the absolutely "best ones" for learning web development.

## JavaScript
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) - absolutely everything you need to learn about vanilla JavaScript

## Node.js
- [Nodejs.dev](https://nodejs.dev/learn) - a wonderful introduction to the Node.js and npm world explained for beginners.
  
  Some topics covered on it:
  - Differences between Node.js and JavaScript on the browser.
  - Installing and using Node.js in the console.
  - Understanding, instaling and using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), the Node.js package manager.
  - Understanding async programming, making HTTP requests, working with files (file stats, paths, reading and writing files, etc.).
